## Projects (by index)

1. **Button Color Changer**
   - Approach: Randomize the page background from a predefined palette, avoiding the same color twice; implemented with `useState` and inline styles.
   - Outcome: Demonstrates state-driven styling, transitions, and event handling.

2. **Character Counter Input**
   - Approach: Controlled text input that updates character count in real time (`useState`).
   - Outcome: Shows controlled components, live UI updates, and accessibility labels.

3. **Click Tracker App**
   - Approach: Simple click counter using `useState` and an increment button.
   - Outcome: Demonstrates event handlers and basic state updates.

4. **Counter App**
   - Approach: Increment / decrement / reset with accessible buttons and `aria-live` for updates.
   - Outcome: Example of state operations and accessible UI patterns.

5. **Simple Login UI (No Backend)**
   - Approach: Controlled login form with client-side validation; toggles to a welcome view on 'login' (no backend calls).
   - Outcome: Illustrates form handling, validation, and conditional rendering for auth state.

6. **Simple text display**
   - Approach: Controlled input that shows live output and explanatory notes about state handling.
   - Outcome: Good starter for understanding controlled inputs and rendering.

7. **Text & Hide**
   - Approach: In-browser React (UMD + Babel) demo that toggles an input between password/text and shows length; includes a small Node static server (`serve.js`).
   - Outcome: Lightweight show/hide text example without a build step.

8. **Todo app**
   - Approach: Feature-rich todo list with add/edit/delete, filters (all/active/completed), clear completed, color picker, and confirm dialogs; state flows via props and update callbacks.
   - Outcome: Demonstrates list management, controlled forms, edit flows, and UI state patterns useful for larger apps.

9. **Toggle Theme**
   - Approach: Small reusable component that toggles theme state and adjusts styles (button shows light/dark iconography).
   - Outcome: Practical example of prop-driven presentation and theming hooks.
