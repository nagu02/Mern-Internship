# Simple Login UI (No Backend)

A tiny React app (Create React App compatible) that demonstrates a simple login form with username, password, and a conditional welcome message.

## Features
- Controlled inputs for username and password
- Form submit handling that prevents page reload
- Conditional rendering: shows a welcome message after login

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the app:

```bash
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000

> If you don't have the dependencies installed or prefer a full CRA scaffold: run `npx create-react-app .` in an empty folder and replace the `src` and `public` files with the ones in this repo.
