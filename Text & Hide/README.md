Show / Hide Text - React (No Vite)

What this is
- A tiny React example that implements Task 4: a password input with a visibility toggle.
- Uses boolean state and conditional rendering.

How to run

Option A — Quick: Open directly
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (no build step required).
2. Click the **Show text** button to reveal the paragraph; click again to hide it.

Option B — Recommended: Run with Node (no Python)
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000

Notes
- This example uses React via CDN and Babel in the browser so you don't need Vite or any bundler.
- If you'd prefer a different Node-based setup (Parcel/webpack), tell me and I can set it up.
